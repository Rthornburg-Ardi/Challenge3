# <Challenge 3>

## Description

This is meant to be a password generator for employees dealing with sensitive data. The app is built with HTML and CSS that is powered by JavaScript. It is meant to be run on a web browser, as most data now lives in cloud services. The app will be responsive to any type of screen that it is used on.
